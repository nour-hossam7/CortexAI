# 🧠 Cortex AI
### Multimodal Brain Tumor Clinical Decision Support System

> Graduation Project | Artificial Intelligence | Medical Imaging | NLP | Explainable AI

Cortex AI is an AI-powered clinical decision support system designed to assist healthcare professionals in brain tumor diagnosis by combining MRI image analysis and radiology report understanding.

The system leverages Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Multimodal Learning, and Explainable AI to provide accurate, interpretable, and reliable diagnostic insights.

---

# 📌 Problem Statement

Brain tumor diagnosis often relies on multiple sources of information, including MRI scans and radiology reports. Analyzing these sources separately may lead to incomplete understanding and delayed decision-making.

Cortex AI addresses this challenge by integrating medical imaging data and textual clinical information into a unified intelligent system capable of supporting diagnostic decisions.

# 🎯 Project Objectives

- Detect and analyze brain tumors from MRI scans.
- Extract meaningful information from radiology reports.
- Combine image and text features using Multimodal Fusion.
- Provide transparent and explainable predictions.
- Support clinicians with AI-assisted decision-making.
